    "Scientist are consistently working on creating new drug products, but the process of developing new drugs has significantly improved with the advent of new and more powerful technologies. Drug discovery has changed in that it is approached to target specific mechanism of a disease. Which is to identify a protein target associated with a disease and then develop a drug that is able to modulate the protein, thus reducing or eliminating the disease. \n",

    "The dataset is a combination of gene expression and cell viability data. The data is from a new technology that measures simultaneously human cells' responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types. Also the data has annotations for more than 5,000 drugs in that dataset. \n",

    "Other Questions/Insights from the data:\n",
    "- What is the overall biological activity of a given molecule/drug? (Does it impact other cell type?)\n",
    "- Are there any cell types that are always affected?\n",
    "- Are there drugs that are intended for a specific cell type but have equal or greater effects on other cell types?\n",

    "A drug discovery program is setup to maximize the full knowledge of a molecule prior to every being tested/given to a human. There is a full understanding of a new drug in vitro and in vivo. There are many factors that are studied beyond just the MOA of a drug such as Negative Feedback regulation of a specific target. Additionally it is noted that drugs may have interactions with multiple targets, with varying affinities (affinity is related on how a molecule reaction/interaction/acceptance).\n",

    "3. Modeling with omnics data\n",

    "With the advent of large drug-induced gene expression profiles machine learning/predictive modeling methods is an effective methods for discovering the MOA of drugs. However there is a lack of adoption by people since there is a lack in open source platforms/code and user friendly platforms. Overall they developed a GPAR method and online tool to connect MOA with gene expression signatures, providing a simple and effective deep learning-based modeling and prediction method for drug researchers.
